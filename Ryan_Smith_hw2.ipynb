        "Now, you may find out that we have a categorical feature 'primary_strength' in our data. Categorical features require special attention because usually they cannot be the input of regression models as they are. A potential way to treat categorical features is to simply convert each value of the feature to a separate number. However, this might impute non-existent relative associations between the features, which might not always be representative of the data (e.g., if we assign “1” to the value “green” and “2” to the value “red”, the regression algorithm will assume that “red” is greater than “green,” which is not necessarily the case). For this reason, we can use a “one hot encoding” to represent categorical features. According to this, we will create a binary column for each category of the categorical feature, which will take a value of 1 if the sample belongs to that category, and 0 otherwise. For each categorical feature of the problem, count the number of different values and implement the one hot encoding. For the remaining of the problem, you will be working with the one hot encoding of the categorical features.\n",
